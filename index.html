<h2 id="unmarked">Unmarked population models</h2>
<p>We develop models to estimate the abundance, distribution, and demographic rates of populations using unmarked data, or data types that do not track individuals. These efforts allow us to quantitatively evaluate important life history parameters with less sampling effort than is traditionally required with mark-recapture studies.</p>

      <strong>Abstract</strong> -  Using a novel disease-structured N-mixture model, we evaluate empirical support for three host-pathogen coexistence hypotheses (source-sink, eco-evolutionary rescue, and spatial variation in pathogen transmission) in a Neotropical amphibian community decimated by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) six years earlier. We found that the primary driver of host-pathogen coexistence was eco-evolutionary rescue, as evidenced by the similar amphibian survival and recruitment rates between infected and uninfected hosts.

<h2 id="community">Community analyses</h2>
<p>Assessing the impacts of climate and habitat on communities of species is increasingly important as abiotic conditions continue to change. Yet, most data collection techniques do not produce enough data for analyses on a majority of species observed during sampling. We develop multi-species models to estimate the effects of environmental covariates on all species within a community, including those that are rare or elusive.</p>

            <strong>Abstract</strong> -  We quantify the response of amphibian species and communities to landscape-scale characteristics in streams within the fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We developed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to quantify the influence of landscape-scale characteristics (forest cover, agriculture, catchment area, stream density and slope) on amphibian occurrence probabilities while accounting for imperfect detection of species using two survey methods (Standardized Acoustic and Visual Transect Sampling and Automated Acoustic Recorders). Our findings suggest that small streams and flat topography lead to higher amphibian occurrence probabilities for many species in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest.

Our models also incorporate imperfect detection as well as abundance estimation error for both species. We applied the model to four pairs of mammal species in Borneo (civet, macaque, muntjac deer, and porcupine), surveyed by extensive and spatially widespread camera trapping.

                      <strong>Abstract</strong> - The hierarchical community model is a multi-species approach to obtain community information, such as species or assemblage richness, by estimating individual species occurrence and detection probabilities. We provide example code and data based off of Zipkin et al. 2010 (Biological Conservation) to demonstrate how to implement multi-species hierarchical models with and without covariates.

                      <strong>Abstract</strong> -  We present an approach to extend the two dimensional ellipse niche model into three dimensions to estimate significant features of a population's isotopic niche space including: 1) niche volume, 2) relative centroid location, 3) shape, 4) area of overlap between multiple ellipsoids and 5) distance between centroids. We conducted a simulation study showing the accuracy and precision of three dimensional niche models across a range of valuesapply the approach to three bottlenose dolphin populations.

                      <strong>Abstract</strong> - We develop a generalizable tool, the “Regime Shift Detector” for adapting a simple density dependent model to detecting shifts in dynamic regime in population time series data. This tool was developed as a suite of functions for examining population time series data for the presence, location, and magnitude of shifts, using an iterative approach to fitting the Ricker model on subsets of the time series, and ranking the fit of the break point combination using model selection. We examined the performance of this tool with simulated data and two real-world case studies of involving 20-year population time series datasets documenting species of conservation and economic concern.

<p>We develop modules to share our research (and love of science!) with the public. The objective of our outreach activities are to enhance awareness of our research findings and show the value of statistics, mathematics, and coding in ecology through interactive activities.</p>

      In this activity, you will learn about monarch butterfly biology and how math models can help understand the many threats to their population. See how the monarch population may increase or decrease with a hands-on modeling experience, which allows you to adjust the amount of plant resources on the landscape, climate conditions, and other environmental variables. Watch the model results on your computer screen!
    </p>

      This activity was created strictly for educational purposes. It is NOT meant to make real-world predictions nor should it be used to inform management. Data on monarch abundance (1994-2016) were provided by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
